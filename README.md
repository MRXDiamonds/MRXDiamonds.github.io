This was an educational project created by Jordan Peters for iD Tech Camps' Cryptography and Cyber Security course, 
which I had the opportunity to test at a pre-season camp. This course was designed for 6 kids rangeing from late middle 
school to high school, and I got to almost entirely determine the course's content for the week.
